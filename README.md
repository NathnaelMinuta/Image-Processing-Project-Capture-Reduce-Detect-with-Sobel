## <p align="center"><u>Introduction and Description</u></p>
The primary purpose of this mini project is to familiarize us with fundamental image processing techniques and algorithms, empowering them to manipulate and analyze digital images effectively using C++. By the end of the mini project, we have gained proficiency in capturing, processing, and interpreting visual information, laying a solid foundation for further exploration in advanced image processing topics. 

The goals of the software development encompass not only technical proficiency but also critical thinking skills, we will be challenged to apply our knowledge to solve practical problems in robotics and beyond. Through a structured methodology of experimentation, analysis, and documentation, we will emerge from this mini project with a deeper understanding of the principles of image processing and their applications in real-world scenarios.

Task 1 introduced us to the basic but critical process of image capture and resolution reduction. Utilizing the Raspberry Pi camera, we captured raw images and employed the adjacent-averaging method to distill these images into 48x48 pixel approximations. This exercise was not just about shrinking image sizes but about understanding the nuances of image fidelity, data representation, and the trade-offs involved in image processing applications.

Task 2 delved into the Sobel Edge Detection algorithm, a fundamental technique in the domain of image analysis. By applying this algorithm, we explored the identification of edges within images, a critical step in object detection, image segmentation, and further processing tasks. This task not only challenged our coding skills but also our understanding of mathematical concepts underlying edge detection and their practical applications in computer vision.
